# Git Commit #
The **git commit** command gives us information of our repository at a given time. The use of the **git commit -m** flag provides us with a commit message. This provides context about the commit.A descriptive message is also added for reference

# Git Checkout -b #
The **git checkout -b** command enables us create a branch. This can be used to copy our main source code which will enable  us make changes without affecting our source code. This can be helpful when trying to develop a feature as improvements can be made here and tested before being added to our main source code.
